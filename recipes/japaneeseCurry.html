        The bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, 
        and the fluffy rice are what makes every bite so comforting and exciting to eat. Not only is it a meal thatâ€™s easy to make on busy nights, 
        but it also tastes better the second day.
