    <!-- For this, we had to seperated the top element in order to get it to be styled (Manual). Then we could wrap the 4th and 5th element.
    Additionally, on the .css file, we cant just use div {} because on the webpage it will only count it a two pieces, so the 4th and 5th element become 
    one big element versus being seperated by a space. -->
